# python-objktquery
### by culla
This will allow the user to make querys of objkt collections using the GraphicQL API with python.

### Installation
You will need to install python on your machine

[download python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

FOR WINDOWS just use the executable

FOR linux based systems you should already have Python installed. I would assume Mac systems have it bundled too?

And install the dependencies GQL
-pip install --pre gql[all]

IN WINDOWS you may need to use "py -m" at the beginning

-py -m pip install --pre gql[all]

OR alternatively you can just double click the py file itself that you want to use.

FOR MAC (I don't own or use a Mac but these intructions should be substitable)
